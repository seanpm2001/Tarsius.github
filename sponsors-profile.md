Short bio (125 characters)
==========================

Introduction
============

I am the maintainer of [Magit](https://magit.vc) one of the most [popular](http://www.melpa.org/#/?sort=downloads&asc=false) and even [beloved](https://magit.vc/quotes) Emacs packages. I love seeing it mentioned as "one of Emacs' killer apps" again and again. That feels really good. Thanks!

Unfortunately it does not really translate to a stable income. At the end of 2017 I ran a successful Kickstarter campaign and subsequently was able to improve Magit a lot. 2019 was slower. *Important side notes:* I still owe backers the promised cheat cheats and posters. I'll send those out in January. I do not plan to do another Kickstarter campaign. I would rather have a steady income. That is less stressful, which in turn helps my productivity.

I would like to work full time on Magit and other Emacs related projects again. Please help make that a reality by becoming a sponsor. There's still so much I want to do and if you are one of those people who only has the highest praise for Magit, then you should be excited about that. :grinning:

Beside Magit, I also maintain the [Emacsmirror](https://emacsmirror.net), the [biggest collection](https://github.com/emacsmirror) of Emacs packages. I also regularly contribute to Melpa.

The Emacsmirror as well as my Git submodule based package manager [`borg`](https://emacsmirror.net/manual/borg) go back to about the same time as when `package.el` was born. Ever since then I quietly worked on that, contributing fixes to many hundreds of packages in the process. This work is much less visible, but I believe it had a big impact on the overall quality of third-party packages. For example there are currently only [two feature conflicts](https://emacsmirror.net/stats/issues.html) among the more than 7000 known packages, which is largely my doing.

Based on that work I would like to do more to automate testing of all Emacs packages and automatically suggesting fixes. Currently this work is being done semi-manually when a package is first added to Melpa, but this could and should be done regularly for packages that are already distributed on Melpa and have not been reviewed in a long time or ever.

I'm also the author of another few dozen packages, which are listed at [here](https://github.com/tarsius?tab=repositories), [here](https://github.com/magit) or [here](https://github.com/emacscollective).
