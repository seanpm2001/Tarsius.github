Short bio (125 characters)
==========================

I maintain Magit, which is the most advanaced Git client and by many considered to be one of Emacs' killer apps.

Introduction
============

I am the maintainer of [Magit](https://magit.vc) one of the most [popular](http://www.melpa.org/#/?sort=downloads&asc=false) and even [beloved](https://magit.vc/quotes) Emacs packages. I love seeing it mentioned as "one of Emacs' killer apps" again and again. That feels really good. Thanks!

Please also help me make Magit better by becoming a sponsor. There's still so much I want to do and if you are one of those people who only has the highest praise for Magit, then you should be excited about that. :grinning:

Additionally I maintain

* [Forge](https://github.com/magit/forge) an extension to Magit, which allows you to use Github and Gitlab from the comfort of Emacs.

* [Transient](https://github.com/magit/transient), the package used to implement Magit's menus and an [increasing number](https://melpa.org/#/transient) of third-party packages.  This package is part of Emacs since the 28.1 release and is used by the built-in Emoji package.

* [`package-build`](https://github.com/melpa/package-build), which is used to build the package distributed on [Melpa](https://melpa.org).

* The [Emacsmirror](https://emacsmirror.net), the [biggest collection](https://github.com/emacsmirror) of Emacs packages. I also regularly contribute to Melpa.

* The Emacsmirror as well as my Git submodule based package manager [`borg`](https://emacsmirror.net/manual/borg) go back to about the same time as when `package.el` was born. Ever since then I quietly worked on that, contributing fixes to many hundreds of packages in the process. This work is much less visible, but I believe it has a big impact on the overall quality of packages.

* A few dozen other packages, which are listed [here](https://github.com/tarsius?tab=repositories), [here](https://github.com/magit) or [here](https://github.com/emacscollective).

I also regularly contribute to [Melpa](https://melpa.org).

I blog on [Emacsair](https://emacsair.me) and sometimes [tweet](https://twitter.com/magit_emacs).
